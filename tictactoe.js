// Make a command line tic-tac-toe game from scratch for two players. 
// Expected features
// ===============
// * Minimal UI that redraws the board and makes clear whose turn it is, each turn.
// * Players can submit moves (assume, admittedly unrealistically, that both players are sitting at the same keyboard).
// * Win detection - detect and display who won

// Bonus / stretch goals (any or all of the following)
// =======================================
// * Structure your code such that the UI can be turned easily into a native mobile app (iOS say) without having to rewrite the core game logic.
// * Implement win detection with a functional rather than iterative style.
// * Between moves, rotate the board 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The moves "fall" due to "gravity", post-rotation.

// Implementation instructions
// =======================
// * Create the project from scratch. Don't just clone an existing project.
// * This includes writing configuration files for any dependencies and test framework setup.
// * You should have a reasonably thorough suite of unit tests using a real unit test framework.
// * Use the editor of your choice.
// * Init a git repo for this project.
// * Push the repo up to github.
// * Make small commits as you go to illustrate your thought process and be able to back out changes easily.
// * Don't forget to push your final solution up to Github.
// * Add a professional-looking README file with installation and usage instructions.

// Try your best to work on this challenge without referring to outside resources. However, if you have to look things up online, go ahead. 

// Submission instructions
// ====================
// Upon completion of your work, submit a link to the repository via this form.

// var board = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]];
